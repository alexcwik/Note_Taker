This is a Note Taker application created using express.js. 

When opened the user can input text and save each text entry as a note. Each note is then saved and displayed on the right side of the application. The user also has the ability to delete a note using the delete icon. 

One of the more siginificant issues was getting the app to upload to Heroku. After many attempts the code was eventually pushed to Heroku. But the attempts to get it to upload caused different issues with the functionality of the code. The app works but only using the node server.js command. The issue seems to be the start script is missing from the json file. The issue is currently being worked on.
